We scraped archives again; with new criteria (will add mat script at some point).

```
- now has pursuit
    - ~30 sessions; 1.4K trials of observation (~2.8Ks), x3 for ortho/fbc.
  - CRS02b: Bulk of pursuit <2016, a few ~12/2017.
  - CRS07: Newest from ~12/23, most are older (2021/2022).
- covariate shapes are checked to need to match spike shape
- restricted much more tightly to 2D reach tasks -- data name indicates acutal paradigm
    - In general all paradigms may include a click dimension which I ignore.
    - CRS02b: Spans from 2016 -> 2023.
    - CRS07: Spans from 2021 -> 2023.
